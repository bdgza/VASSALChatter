# VASSALChatter

Xamarin.Forms project for iOS and Android to create a mobile app that can connect to the VASSAL chat server.

## Features

* Get notified of players joining a module lobby, without needing to stay at your desk
* Let your opponent know you will be right back at your computer so they don't leave
